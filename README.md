# Exploring World Development Indicators

As part of our Viz of the Day we looked at GDP as a development indicator and we suggested for a better viz, we should look at other indicators as well! 

### IF NOT NOW? WHEN?

The United Nations sets goals ranging from eradicating poverty and zero hunger, to gender equality and climate action

We face big challenges in todayâ€™s world: poverty, hunger, inequality and climate change are issues we need to address urgently.

We can quantify these challenges through World Development Indicators.

### Understanding Data
Before we start exploring and visualizing the data we had to clean and preprocess the shape and indicators data:
- When we got the data it was in a short data shape where all the indicators were in rows and year was in column
- We had to pivot the data through python due to the size of the data to put year on the row and each indicator as a column
- The data was not grouped by continent
- We had to map the data by continent to allowed us to further explore 
- Clean out null values and recognize which indicators were useful
- Using domain knowledge and additional research we had to understand each indicators and if it would be useful to our business problem
